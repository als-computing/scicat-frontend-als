## Summary

SciCat is a data catalogue web application to provide a searchable interface for datasets, publish DOIs,
as well as the option to carry out actions (i.e. archiving and publishing) and acts as a place to reference datasets used in publications.

For the full documentation please go to the [SciCat home page](https://scicatproject.github.io/) and follow the [documentation link](https://scicatproject.github.io/documentation)

## Note: This repo has a default branch of "ALS-Customizations", not the usual default of "master".

If you wish to contribute code back to the main SciCat project, merge your branch to master and make the pull request from there.

Avoid merging "ALS-Customizations" into master.

### Differences between "ALS Customizations" and the official repo as of Apr 2025:

* Draft feature work to add collections of external links to data sets
